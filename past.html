    <h1>MEDICAL RECORD DEPARTMENT</h1>
    <h4>
        <P><b>
                Medical health records form an essential part of a patient’s present and future health care.
                As a written collection of information about a patient’s health and treatment, they are used essentially
                for the present and continuing care of the patient. In addition, medical records are used in the
                management and planning of health care facilities and services,
                for medical research and the production of health care statistics.</P>

        <p>The medical record is an important compilation of facts about a
            patient’s life and health. It includes documented data on past and present illnesses and treatment written
            by health care professionals caring for the patient. The medical record "must contain sufficient data to
            identify the patient,
            support the diagnosis or reason for attendance at the health care facility,
            justify the treatment and accurately document the results of that treatment” (Huffman, 1990).</p>
    </h4>


    <p>The main purpose of the medical record is:

        To record the facts about a patient's health with
        emphasis on events affecting the patient during the current admission or attendance at the health care facility,
        and
        For the continuing care of the patient when they require health care in  the  future.</p>
    </h4>
    <h3>
        <p>A patient’s medical record should provide accurate information on:</p>
        <br>
        1. who the patient is and who provided health care
        <br>
        2. what, when, why and how services were provided and
        <br>
        3. the outcome of care and treatment. The medical record has four major sections
        </p>
    </h3>
    </div>
    <h4>
        <p>Administrative, which includes demographic and socioeconomic data such as the name of the patient
            (identification), sex, date of birth, place of birth, patient’s permanent address, and medical record number
            Legal data including a signed consent for treatment by appointed doctors and authorization for the release
            of information
            Clinical data on the patient whether admitted to the hospital or treated as an outpatient or an
            emergency patient.</p>
    </h4>
    <ul class="list-unstyled"><input type="hidden">
        <li>The main uses of the medical records are:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>To document the course of the patient's illness and treatment
            </li>
            <li>To communicate between attending doctors and other health care professionals providing care to the
                patient
            </li>
            <li>For the continuing care of the patient
            </li>
            <li>For research of specific diseases and treatment; and
                The collection of health statistics.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>This may still come in handy in some situations.</li></b>
